We are using \uppaalsmc \cite{SMC} to perform a formalized statistical simulation of our models, known as Statistical Model Checking (SMC). SMC enables quantitative performance measurements instead of the Boolean (true, false) evaluation that symbolic model checking techniques provide.    
We can summarize the main features of \uppaalsmc in the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Stopwatches \cite{DBLP:conf/concur/CassezL00} are clocks that can be stopped and resumed without a reset. They are very practical to measure the execution time of preemptive tasks.
\item Simulation and estimation of the expected minimum or maximum value of expressions over a set of runs, \texttt{E[bound](min:expr)} and \texttt{E[bound](max:expr)}, for a given simulation time and/or number of runs specified by \texttt{bound}. 
\item Probability evaluation \texttt{Pr[bound] (P)} for a property \texttt{P} to be satisfied within a given simulation time and/or number of runs specified by \texttt{bound}. \texttt{P} is specified using either LTL or tMITL logic. 
\end{itemize}

Statistical model checking does not provide complete certainty that a property is satisfied, but only verifies it up to a specific confidence level \cite{DBLP:conf/formats/DavidLLMPVW11}, given as an analysis parameter.
