%This paper introduces a model-based framework for schedulability and interference sensitive WCET analysis. The framework captures both the multicore platform and system application given in terms of periodic non preemptive tasks. Our framework is realized using timed automata and stopwatch clocks of Uppaal, while the analysis is performed using both statistical and symbolic model checking techniques. In case of non-schedulability, we provide a technique to analyze the cores utilization and study the impact of tasks migration with the goal to find potential mappings with which the system becomes schedulable.
***Summary of the paper

As future work, we plan to compare the performance results obtained using our framework with the state of the art tools \cite{6280389,10.1109/MS.2005.102}. We intend also to incorporate detailed architectures of L2 and DRAM, consider other factors in the derivation of configurations such as task-to-core mapping where we reallocate tasks to cores differently and the use of other performance metrics such as energy consumption.
